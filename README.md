## Required Additional Functionality

The following required enhancements were successfully implemented:

- **Application Title**  
  The application title was updated from *Movie App* to include my own name.  
  New title: **RindelloBlazorFirstMovieApp**.

- **Seed Data**  
  At least three of my favorite movies were added to the initial seed data:
  - *Toy Story 3*
  - *Blade Runner*
  - *Titanic*

- **Movie Listing Title**  
  The movie listing page title was changed from *Index* to **My Movies** for better clarity and user experience.

- **Year Filter**  
  A new filter option was added that allows the user to select a year.  
  The movie list is filtered to show movies released in the selected year or newer.

- **Styling Improvements**  
  General styling improvements were made by adding padding to form elements (`input`, `select`, `textarea`, etc.) so that text is not pressed against the borders.  
  These styles were added globally in `site.css`.
