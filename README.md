Hello Grader!
Required Additional Functionality was added:

    Change the title of the App from Movie App to include your own name, e.g., "Rodriquez Movies". -> changed to RindelloBlazorFirstMovieApp
    Add at least three (3) of your own favorite movies to the data. -> added on SeedData: Toy Story 3, Blade Runner and Titanic.
    Change the movie listing title so that it does not say "Index", rather it says the something like "My Movies". -> Done!
    Add the ability to select a year which filters the displayed movies on that year or newer to the search options. -> Done!
    Improve the styling of the page by add padding to the form elements used for any type of input, i.e., input, select, textarea, etc. so that the text is not jambed up against the input element border. -> added general styles on site.css :)
